The Hello World program / script is usually the first thing you code whenever you learn a new scripting or programming language. The program prints out "hello world" to the screen, it might not seem like a great achievement. However when you're just starting out, any kind of progress is welcome. The Hello World script is simple enough that most people should be able to write it and run it afterwards.

If you are writing compiled code the Hello World program also serves as a check to ensure you are able to compile and run your programs.
